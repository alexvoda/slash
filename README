NAME
    README - Slash Readme

WARNING
    This release of Slash is BETA software. Run at your own risk. There ARE
    bugs, there ARE broken and incomplete features, and documentation is not
    yet finished or wrong. For a production-quality release of Slash, see
    http://slashcode.com/.

DESCRIPTION
    Slash is the code that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is
    an architecture for putting together web sites. It comes with
    functionality for posting articles, conducting polls, having
    discussions, and more. But it can be extended in innumerable ways.

    Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl. It
    requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
    used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as time
    goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way). Slash is fast,
    scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases you
    could have, running Slashdot itself).

    Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash.
    Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
    the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

    See INSTALL for information about installing Slash, including hardware
    and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
    instructions as precisely as possible.

    There is no upgrade information yet; we will write information on
    upgrading from a 1.0.x site soon.
