HOWTO-Plugin - How to write and use Slash plugins

=head1 What is a plugin?

A plugin is an extension to the Slash system
that adds some sort of functionality to
the site. It should inherit its basic look
and feel from the currently running theme
(for example, backgroun/foreground colors, calling
header and footer components, etc. will be handled
by the installed theme).

=head1 How do I get my plugin into the install system?

There are two ways to do this. First, you can put it in the
plugin directory with the distribution. During the install it
will be copied to the plugin directory in (by default,
F</usr/local/slash/plugins/>. The second option is to copy it in
there yourself and make sure that your library files (perl modules)
are installed. If you decide to go the first route you
may want to consider adding your libraries to the list
that get installed from the Makefile.
# add them to what list in which Makefile?  do you mean the
# Makefile for the plugin? -- pudge

=head1 What does my plugin need to make it work with the install?

If you look at the plugins that come with Slash you will find a 
file called PLUGIN. This handles how the plugin installer will
see your plugin. The following are the keywords it knows:
# What is the syntax of the file? -- pudge

needed, or other dependencies.

=head1 How do I install a plugin once my site is installed?

Use the install-plugin tool.
# Give basic directions on how to use it; perhaps an example or two,
# and then a place to look for more information. -- pudge

=head1 Do install-plugin and install-slashsite use the same logic?

Yes, you can find it in the Slash::Install library.

=head1 I have a really cool plugin and I would like to see it added to the Slash
distribution. Will you distribute mine?

Maybe. We don't have any rules concerning this at the moment, so it will be
on a case by case basis. At some point in the future we will come up
with a much better answer.
