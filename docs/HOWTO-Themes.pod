How to write and use Themes

=head1 What is a theme?

A theme is a website design. It can have some functionality
to it (like the slashcode theme is a weblog). Functionality
though is normally split into seperate plugins.

=head1 How do I get my theme into the install system?

Two ways to do this, first you can put it in the theme directory 
with the distribution. During the install it will be copied
to the theme directory in /usr/local/slash. The second
option is to copy it in there yourself. The directory layout
is very important with themes. The install expects to find
a sql directory with a mysql and postgresql directory in it.
It expects a templates directory with templates in it and
finally it expects an htdocs directory. It copies files 
directly from htdocs to the install's directory.
Look at the slashcode theme as an example.

=head1 Ok, what does my theme have to have to make it work with the install?

Just the directory structure explained above. Right now there
is no THEME file like there is a PLUGIN file for PLUGINS.
Expect this to change at some point in the future.

=head1 I have a really cool theme and I would like to see it added to the slash distribution. Will you distributed mine?

Maybe? We don't have any rules concerning this at the moment, so it will be
on a case by case basis. At some point in the future we will come up
with a much better answer.
