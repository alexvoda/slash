------------------------------

*	Changed copyright/license info in source files

*	Changed SQL files to be extended INSERTs for increased
	compatability

*	Added more documentation in Slash::DB

*	Fix author sessions

*	Save templates into their own directory, as individual

	(for saving to filesystem and for displaying in comments)

------------------------------

First beta for Slash 2.0.  EVERYTHING changed.  We won't even bother
listing it all.  Just a few highlights:

	database-independent with support for MySQL and initial,
	alpha-level support for PostgreSQL

*	Use Template Toolkit for displaying text

*	More hooks into Apache

*	Redesigned login and authentication

*	Redesigned paths etc. on the filesystem

*	Simplified installation and configuration

That's all.  See the other docs and appropriate forums for more details.
